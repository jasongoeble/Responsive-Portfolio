                Hey everyone, here you'll find a bit of information about...well, me.  Clearly you're interested.  I mean who wouldn't be.
                However, it is entirely possible that you are being forced to read this, or at least the code behind what you are seeing on
                the page.  Either way, I hope you are at least mildly entertained.

                While I'm a very personable individual, I have never been a morning person.  So it is probably in your best interest to not expect too 
                much unless I've had a sufficient dose of coffee.  However, after the first cup of coffee I am good to go.  Interest-wise, too much to put here,
                but most people have music preferences so I will start with that.  If you're interested in any of the following groups or genres there's a pretty good 
                chance we'll get along.
